## Articles

Originally, what started as scribbles of journal notes eventually became a GitHub repo. Over time, I try to stitch them into articles, [blikies](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html), or whatever you'd like to call them — raw and pulled straight from real-world debugging, trial runs, and occasional *what on earth is this?* moments.

I've been sharing them out in the open — where ideas circulate and maybe help someone else along the way. Learn more with great articles:
