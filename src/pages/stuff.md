### Software

My development setup can be found in [my dotfiles repo on GitHub](https://github.com/kosperera/dotfiles) — CLI tools, SDKs, apps, and everything in between.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with [Devcontainers](https://github.com/kosperera?tab=repositories&q=try-&type=&language=&sort=) is the only Editor turned IDE worth using for C# and Jakarta on a Mac. Previously [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and [IntelliJ IDEA CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide#readme-ov-file), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#readme-ov-file), and [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to make the my Terminal smarter.
- [Typora app](https://typora.io) is my go-to markdown editor for docs and notes taking.
- [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com) is for diagrams.
- [Procreate](https://procreate.com/procreate) is wonderful for sketching and creative works — but I dabbles!



#### Services

- [GitHub](https://github.com/kosperera) used to be my unicorn and now it is *my bitch!*
- Azure and AWS is for the love of cloud architectures and development.
- Microsoft 365 and OneDrive for obvious reasons.
