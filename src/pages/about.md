## About

I'm Kosala (KP) Perera, one of the Software Architects at [Virtusa](https://www.virtusa.com). Over the years, I’ve spent countless hours designing and coding backend-heavy web and enterprise applications — think [RESThooks](https://www.olioapps.com/blog/rest-hooks), Event-driven, Microservices — for clients across Sri Lanka, Sweden, Norway, Australia, and the US.

### What I value most

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work alongside hundreds of developers — across time zones, cultures, and codebases. I've picked up a few principles that shape how I work — both as a team member and as a lead:

- [Egalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante) team culture over rockstars and lone-wolf coders
- Technical facts and data over opinions and personal preferences
- Style guides over personal habits
- Time-tested design principles over opinionated-design
- Consistent and cohesive code over personal preferences

### What I geek out on

Outside of my day-to-day, I've been a longtime Hubber — sharing knowledge thru workshops, blog posts, and the occasional tech talk (whiteboard markers and all). Here's is a quick snapshot of what I'm usually wired into:

- .NET (C#) if not Quarkus (Java) Backends with enuf frontend curiosity
- AWS/Azure Serverless, Containerless, and Messaging
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and the Pipelines, and
- [*Caffeine* needed to build, break, and ship a *good first issue*](https://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#starting-from-what-you-have)

I’ve jotted down all the stuff I rely on — from editors to infrastructure — in one spot. Check out [my stuff](/uses/).

### What I keep coming back to

Here are five things you seriousely didn't know about me:

- I've been smoke-free since Oct 20, 2023 — Haven't looked back. No regrets.
- I typically binge books and videos at ~1.5x speed — because there's too much good content and too little time.
- I'm drawn to cinematic magic and the behind-the-scenes craft enhances my enjoyment — it doesn't spoil the magic.
- I can't help but wonder if I'd written a Nolan-style thriller or a GRRM-esque high fantasy saga — it woud've rocked.
- Back in '95, I crossed paths with a seer who foretold a future that came eerily close to becoming inevitable.
