## About

I'm [Kosala (KP) Perera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kosperera). And this URL has been my online home for a longtime.

Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working on some amazing products and brands across Sri Lanka, Sweden, Norway, Australia, and the US. I've spent countless hours designing and coding backend-heavy web and enterprise applications — think Monoliths, [BFF](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/117phzn/comment/j9e691w/), Event-driven, [RESThooks](https://www.olioapps.com/blog/rest-hooks), [MACH](https://macharchitecture.com) et al.

I've had the opportunity to work alongside hundreds of developers — across time zones, cultures, and codebases. I've picked up a few principles that shape how I work — both as a team member and as a lead:

- [Objectives and key results](https://rework.withgoogle.com/en/guides/set-goals-with-okrs) and initiatives
- [Mr Right and Mr Right Now](https://www.realstorygroup.com/Blog/flirting-enterprise-technology-mr-right-or-mr-right-now)
- [Kaizen](https://www.kaizen-news.com/the-history-and-origins-of-kaizen-a-japanese-business-philosophy/) — think boyscout rule of the west
- [Egalitarian culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante) — no rockstars and lone-wolf coders

Outside of day-to-day, I've been a longtime Hubber — sharing knowledge thru [blikies](/articles/), workshops and the occasional [tech talk](/talks/) (whiteboard markers and all). Here's a quick snapshot of what I'm usually wired into:

- .NET (C#) backends and frontend curiosity
- Serverless [on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless) and [on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/)
- Application integration [on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/products/application-integration/) and [on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/integration-services)
- Infrastructure as code [with OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/) and [with Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform#get-started)
- Release engineering [on Azure Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops) and [on Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understanding-github-actions), and
- [*Caffeine* needed to build, break, and ship a *good first issue*](https://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#starting-from-what-you-have)

### Did you know?

Here are five things you seriously didn't know about me:

- I've been *smoke-free* since Oct 20, 2023 — Haven't looked back. No regrets.
- I typically binge books and videos at ~1.5x speed — because there's too much good content and too little time.
- I'm drawn to [cinematic magic](https://www.ilm.com) and the behind-the-scenes craft enhances my enjoyment — it doesn't spoil the magic.
- I'm into [bouldering and climbing](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1emq-Tbw7AE7LmFsSdycMSNiWq3A_eze&si=dgIQ3Q4FZksLemUj) — it's my escape hatch, the thing that clears my head and reminds me I'm alive.
- I can't help but wonder if I'd written a [Nolan-style thriller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67e_jl4flpE) or a [GRRM-esque high fantasy saga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcy-EhkHXnE) — it would've rocked <i class="fa-solid fa-face-laugh-squint"></i>
