## About

I'm [Kosala (KP) Perera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kosperera). And this URL has been my online home for a longtime. Also, I'm one of the Software Architects at [Virtusa](https://www.virtusa.com).

Over the years, I've spent countless hours designing and coding backend-heavy web and enterprise applications — think [RESThooks](https://www.olioapps.com/blog/rest-hooks), Event-driven, Microservices — for clients across Sri Lanka, Sweden, Norway, Australia, and the US.

I've had the opportunity to work alongside hundreds of developers — across time zones, cultures, and codebases. I've picked up a few principles that shape how I work — both as a team member and as a lead:

- [Egalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante) team culture over rockstars and lone-wolf coders
- Technical facts and data over opinions and personal preferences
- Style guides over personal habits
- Time-tested design principles over opinionated-design
- Consistent and cohesive code over personal preferences

Outside of day-to-day, I've been a longtime Hubber — sharing knowledge thru [blikies](/articles/), workshops and the occasional [tech talk](/talks/) (whiteboard markers and all). Here's a quick snapshot of what I'm usually wired into:

- .NET (C#) or Quarkus (Java) Backends, and enuf frontend curiosity
- AWS or Azure Serverless, Containerless, and Messaging
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and the Pipelines, and
- [*Caffeine* needed to build, break, and ship a *good first issue*](https://producingoss.com/en/producingoss.html#starting-from-what-you-have)

I only accept connection requests from folks I’ve actually met or worked with — stranger requests tend to go unopened. Oh, and if you’re thinking about hiring me for consulting, fair warning: I don’t work for free <i class="fa-solid fa-face-smile-wink fa-lg"></i>

### Did you know?

Here are five things you seriously didn't know about me:

- I've been *smoke-free* since Oct 20, 2023 — Haven't looked back. No regrets.
- I typically binge books and videos at ~1.5x speed — because there's too much good content and too little time.
- I'm drawn to [cinematic magic](https://www.ilm.com) and the behind-the-scenes craft enhances my enjoyment — it doesn't spoil the magic.
- Back in '95, I crossed paths with a [seer](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/seer) who foretold a future that came eerily close to becoming inevitable.
- I can't help but wonder if I'd written a [Nolan-style thriller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67e_jl4flpE) or a [GRRM-esque high fantasy saga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcy-EhkHXnE) — it would've rocked.
