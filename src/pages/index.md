Hey there <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-spock fa-lg"></i>

I'm [Kosala (KP) Perera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kosperera). And this URL has been my online home for a longtime. Also, I'm one of the Software Architects at [Virtusa](https://www.virtusa.com). Over the years, Iâ€™ve spent countless hours designing and coding Monoliths, [BFF](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/117phzn/comment/j9e691w/), Event-driven, [RESThooks](https://www.olioapps.com/blog/rest-hooks), [MACH](https://macharchitecture.com) et al.
