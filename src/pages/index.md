Hey there <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-spock fa-lg"></i>

I'm one of the Software Architects at [Virtusa](https://www.virtusa.com). This URL has been my online home for a longtime. Over the years, I’ve spent countless hours designing and coding backend-heavy web and enterprise applications - think [RESThooks](https://www.olioapps.com/blog/rest-hooks), Event-driven, Microservices - for clients from Sri Lanka to Scandinavia to the US.

For comments or questions, feel free to ask me on [GitHub](https://github.com/kosperera/ama/), on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kosperera), or via email at the real kosala at gmail dot com.

I only accept connection requests from folks I’ve actually met or worked with - stranger requests tend to go unopened. Oh, and if you’re thinking about hiring me for consulting, fair warning: I don’t work for free <i class="fa-solid fa-face-smile-wink fa-lg"></i>
